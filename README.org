** Introduction
   This implementation is intended to be superior to Qt's "signals and slots", becausee
   the Qt version requires a preprocessor. We want this to be pure Rust, no fuss, no muss,
   and no preprocessor requirements. This is Rust, after all!
** Basic Design
   Signals must only be loosely coupled to the slots. As a result, 
   we want signals to be injected into the slots' asynchronous FIFO queue, and the owner
   of the slot to process the queue in its own "thread". The owner will typically
   be a widget, but is not limited to that.
